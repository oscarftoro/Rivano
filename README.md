# Rivano

A tiny programming language to express first order logic formulæ. Juan Rivano Sandoval was a chilean
Philosopher that lived the last part of his life in Lund, Sweeden. Juan Rivano is the author of
the book "Lógica elemental".

## Disclosure

The project is using [Fake](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/) for building, and it has been tested 
only in a [real operating system](http://ubuntustudio.org/),
consequently, there are no guarantees that the project runs on Windows. I am using mono and
monodevelop.

## Compile
to build the parser run on the console...

```bash
build.sh parser
```

the lexer can be built typing:

```bash
build.sh lexer
```
